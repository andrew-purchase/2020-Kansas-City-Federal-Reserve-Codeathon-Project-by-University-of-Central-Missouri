Coronavirus has had a huge impact on family life. Its caused families to spend much 
more time with each other than before the pandemic often causing frustration between family members. 
With the game "RONA!" families are able to connect with each other in a healthy outlet through a fun mini-game that parents can use to help educate kids about coronavirus.

How to play: 

Objective: The first person to move all of your people pieces from their homes to the store wins. 

Players can choose the difficulty of the game by choosing how many people pieces each player has.

On your turn: Click the spinner and get one of the following results: 
-One hand sanitizer appears on the board, and you may walk one space
-You can walk two spaces
-You can walk three spaces
-Two rona appears
-Three rona appears
-Five rona appears
(Note you must use a walk point for your player to exit a house)

How to move people: People can be moved up, down, right, or diagonally depending on players 
choosing. Players cannot move their people onto another person who is already on the board. 
When walking one walk point it spent with each movement on the board.

Role of the rona pieces: Once the rona appears on the right side of the screen click on them to
initiate them to move across the board. If they stop on a player, the player is then infected
with coronavirus and gets sent back home to quarantine. Each rona selected spends a rona point.

Role of hand sanitizer stations: When a player is on a hand sanitizer space, the rona is not
able to infect the player regardless of if they get hit with the virus.

Pass Button: If the pass button is pressed the player will have to answer a question about
coronavirus, if the answer is correct they will earn a walk point. 

This game is just a prototype, if it were to become implemented into society our team would make this game into a web-based application so
that kids would be able to play with other family members such as their grandma in the nursing home.
